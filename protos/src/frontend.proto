// Protocol buffers defining the frontend interface.
//
// This file defines the protocol used between the Python frontend and the Rust simulation/audio components.  Because
// it's for us only, e.g. not over the network, it is acceptable to use required fields so we do so for convenience.
//
// Broadly, this defines a "stack" of a fixed set of UI elements with varying levels of dynamicity.  The Rust backend is
// free to modify the stack at any time, with varying levels of patching supported by each control.  When we do support
// patching, we use a React-inspired algorithm: add a key that is unique and identifies an item in an array, and use
// those to diff.  Generally, though, we can't support reordering because this isn't the web; it is highly unlikely that
// swapping elements around in a listbox or whatever is going to play nice with all screen reader operations.
// Fortunately for our use case, this is probably fine: the really complicated thing is inventory, and all the rest can
// just be clever about sorting.  For example, modifying an action menu is fine, as long as the Rust backend makes sure
// to sort the actions the same way every time, e.g. by category.
